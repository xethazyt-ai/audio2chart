"""Find repeating figures that fit in one or two bars, the way a charter writes them.

Robert: most patterns are one or two bars long for one complete rep, and variety charts
are a mix of everything -- so they are where unlisted vocabulary is most likely to show
up.

This is a different search from chart/discover.py. That one takes gap-based runs and
reports whatever the catalogue fails to claim, which finds fragments as readily as
figures. This one takes the bar grid as the unit, because a rep that repeats is a rep
that fits the bar, and asks which bar-length shapes recur across many charts.

Bar segmentation was recorded as a failure yesterday, and that finding stands: cutting
runs at every bar line shreds anything that legitimately crosses one. The difference is
what the bars are used for. As a segmentation rule they destroy continuous figures; as
a *window* for finding a repeating unit they are exactly the charter's own frame.
