    parameters plus AdamW's two moments), and the four persistent dataloader workers each
    hold up to 2 GB of cached audio at the same time. Two runs died at exactly this point,

    different symptoms, same cause.

    Writing to a sibling temporary file and renaming keeps the atomicity the buffer was
