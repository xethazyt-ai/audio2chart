"""How hard each catalogue pattern actually is, measured rather than assigned.

Robert's section-conditioning plan annotates patterns with difficulty grades. Hand
grading is slow and subjective, and it is the process that put castles in the
catalogue that do not exist. The corpus grades them instead: the same songs are
charted at four levels by the same charter, so where a pattern lands on that ladder is
its grade, from real charts rather than judgement.

A grade is the occurrence-weighted mean level, Easy=1 to Expert=4, over 165,792
occurrences in 150 songs charted at all four levels.

**Read grades against NULL_GRADE, not against 2.5.** Expert sections hold far more
notes than Easy ones -- the level shares here are {100*pooled[l]/total:.0f}/{100*pooled[l]/total:.0f}/{100*pooled[l]/total:.0f}/{100*pooled[l]/total:.0f}
-- so a pattern with no difficulty preference whatsoever still scores 2.76. Only
the distance from that null means anything, which is the same correction
`catalogue_lift` needs and for the same reason.

What it shows: most of the catalogue is universal vocabulary. Anchors, sweeps and
trills appear at every level and mark nothing. Thirteen patterns are genuine Expert
markers, led by the split zigs.

One result worth a charter's eye: `trip zig split G-Y-O` grades +1.02 above null while
`trip zig split G-B-O` grades -0.29 below it. Same named family, opposite ends of the
scale -- G-Y-O splits evenly (deltas 2, 2) and G-B-O does not (3, 1). Either split
regularity matters more than split width, or the 47 occurrences behind G-B-O are too
few to trust. Worth confirming before any of this drives generation.

"""How much of a human Expert chart's pattern vocabulary is Expert markers.

Measured over 80 Expert charts: mean 2.7%, median 1.4%. Real Expert charts are NOT
built from the hardest patterns -- their mean pattern grade is 2.753, sitting on the
null. They use the same universal vocabulary as every other level and arrange it
differently, which is what the difficulty ladder says too: run length quadruples and
the tap rate jumps while the shapes stay ordinary.

A generated chart measured 14.9%, 5.5x the human rate and +3.23 sd out. The model
reaches for split zigs constantly where a charter spends one as a moment of emphasis.
That is a distinct defect from the vocabulary collapse and the weak conditioning,
because it survives at the pattern level where those two do not.

Two claims that looked like the same defect did NOT survive their baselines, and are
recorded so they are not repeated: the generated chart's density is *more* variable
than 93% of human charts (nps variation 0.606 against a human mean 0.409), and its
235-note mean run is normal for Expert, whose own mean is 232. What does survive
alongside the marker overuse is that the chart never rests -- no gap between notes
exceeds 250 ms anywhere in it, where 118 of 120 human Expert charts have broader
rhythm. The long runs follow from that rather than from long phrases.
