"""Distributional metrics for judging whether a generated chart looks like a chart.

Loss and token accuracy cannot answer this. Measured over this corpus, 85.6% of 20 ms grid
slots are padding, so a model that emits nothing at all scores 85.6% token accuracy; the
interesting range is the last 14 points. Cross-entropy is also position-exact, so a chart
shifted by one 20 ms slot scores zero on every note despite being musically identical, and
it rewards under-charting because padding is always the safe guess.

That last failure mode is not hypothetical for this project. The earlier attempt in
`Clone Hero Autocharter` produced 99.2% single notes against 75.3% for humans, and 18.2-note
average runs against 203.4 -- degenerate output that was obvious to a charter and invisible
to any loss curve. A chord-size histogram catches it immediately.

These metrics compare *distributions* between a chart and a reference, on axes a charter
would notice. They say nothing about whether the chart matches the audio -- for that see
onset alignment, which needs the waveform and is deliberately not in this module.

# Measured over 2,995 charts / 8,175,963 note positions (G:\a2c_data\chart_stats.json).

# These are POOLED over positions, so a long dense chart contributes more than a short one.
# ChartProfile measures a single chart, and averaging profiles across charts gives an
# unweighted mean, which is a different estimator: on a 40-chart sample it read pct_sustain
# 0.080 against this 0.045, and nps 10.8 against 7.2. Both are correct for what they
# measure. Compare like with like -- pooled against pooled, or per-chart against per-chart.
# Measured over 250 Expert charts, unweighted per chart -- the estimator that matches a

# Mean and median diverge sharply on pct_tap (0.317 vs 0.194) and pct_sustain (0.152 vs

# and drag the mean. The median is the better target for "a typical chart", and the gap
# between the two is a reminder that a single generated chart cannot be scored against
# a mean without accounting for that spread.

# levels -- same song, same charter, so the differences are difficulty itself.
#
# Difficulty is not density. Notes per second rises only 1.8x across the whole ladder,
# while mean run length is flat through Hard and then quadruples at Expert, and the tap
# rate jumps 72% at that same step. Chords peak at HARD and fall at Expert; sustains
# decrease monotonically as difficulty rises. So the Expert signature is long unbroken
# runs and tap technique, not more notes -- a difficulty control that scales density
# produces a dense Hard chart, not an Expert one.
