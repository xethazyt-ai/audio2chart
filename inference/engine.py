        Density and vocabulary richness pull against each other under a single
        temperature knob. Teacher-forced the model is well calibrated -- 0.343 of its
        mass on chords against a true 0.369, 0.133 on taps against 0.132 -- but free
        running it over-emits notes badly, and raising temperature to recover chords,
        taps and sustains multiplies that. Measured on one clip against a corpus 7.2
        notes per second: temperature 0.5 gives 12.2 nps and no sustains at all, while
        temperature 1.0 gives the right tap and sustain rates at ~44 nps.

        Every step is really two decisions -- emit or stay silent, and what to emit --
        and one temperature governs both, so biasing pad ought to separate them.

        MEASURED: it does not, and the way it fails is the useful part. At temperature
        1.0, top_k 128, against a corpus 7.2 notes per second:

            pad+0   43.7 nps   tap 0.424
            pad+1   30.0 nps   tap 0.353
            pad+2   14.8 nps   tap 0.166
            pad+3    0.66 nps  tap 0.063
            pad+4    0.04 nps

        Nothing lands near 7.2, and one unit between pad+2 and pad+3 collapses output
        22-fold. The bias is also not orthogonal: suppressing notes preferentially
        suppresses chords and taps, so density and vocabulary stay coupled.

        Both follow from the loop being self-reinforcing -- fewer notes emitted changes
        the history the model reads, which makes it expect fewer still, so any
        perturbation amplifies instead of settling. That gain is exposure bias, and it
        shows directly as drift: over one 30s chunk at temperature 1.0 the tap rate
        climbs 0.224 -> 0.454 -> 0.671 -> 0.723, while at temperature 0.5 it is a flat
        0.000 with no sustains. Sharpening suppresses the runaway and the vocabulary
        together.

        Kept as a diagnostic, defaulting to no-op, because it is the knob that made the
        feedback visible and the idea is an obvious one to try again. The fix for the
        vocabulary collapse is in training, not here.
